# Gallows-game
The Gallows Game, a Python-based Hangman implementation, challenges players to guess a random word (e.g., a movie name) within limited chances. Using the random module, a word is chosen, and players uncover its letters before exhausting their given chances (word length + 2). Ideal for programming beginners, enhancing logic and Python skills.
